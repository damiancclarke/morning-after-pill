Subsamples 2+, 3+, 4+ and 5+ are generated to allow comparison of children born at similar birth orders.  For a full description of these groups see the the body of the paper or notes to table \ref{TWINtab:IVAll}. Treated=1 refers to children who are born before a twin while Treated=0 refers to children of similar birth orders not born before a twin.
